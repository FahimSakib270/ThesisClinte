      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Founded in 2023, Profast began with a simple mission: to revolutionize
        parcel delivery in Bangladesh. What started as a small team with big
        dreams has grown into a nationwide network committed to speed,
        reliability, and customer satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
        Our journey began when our founders identified a gap in the market for
        affordable, fast, and transparent parcel delivery services. Today, we
        proudly serve thousands of customers across the country with our
        extensive network of warehouses and dedicated riders.
